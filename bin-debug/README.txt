FIZIX FIGHTER README

Hey! Welcome to FIZIX FIGHTER!

To start playing open FizixFighter.html in your browser.
Select your character!
WASD Moves player 1.
The E button shoots plasma bolts!
The Q Button almost picks up blocks, but is mostly a really dangerous button to press.
The X and C buttons do horrible things to you for debugging purposes!

IJKL Moves player 2 and O shoots (That's an oh not zero)

The camera follows player one. You can look at this as a big advantage for player one, or you can look at this as an opportunity for player two to hide and be sneaky.

The idea of the game is to knock the other guy off the level. Every time you do damage to the other player, he flys farther and farther away with every hit.

Have fun!
